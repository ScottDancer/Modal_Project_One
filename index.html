        Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant.... Why was Crouch pretending
        to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What
        did he think Snape was concealing in his office? And Moody thought he.
        Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea.. . but somehow. Harry
        thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the
        egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he'd like to
        check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career.
        You said you'd already worked out that egg clue!" said Hermione
        indignantly. "Keep your voice down!" said Harry crossly. "I just need to
        - sort of fine-tune it, all right?" He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting
        at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They
        were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today
        - the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when
        objects kept flying across the room. Professor Flitwick had given each
        student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that
        these wouldn't hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good
        theory, but it wasn't working very well. Neville's aim was so poor that
        he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room
        - Professor Flitwick, for instance. "Just forget the egg for a minute,
        all right?" Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly
        past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. "I'm trying to tell you
        about Snape and Moody. ..." This class was an ideal cover for a
